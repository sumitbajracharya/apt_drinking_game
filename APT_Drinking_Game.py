# Apta Apta Game Rules:
#  1. Players stack their hands on top of each other in a pile.
#  2. The leader calls out a number (target number).
#  3. Starting from the bottom, players remove their hands one by one while counting out loud.
#  4. When the count reaches the target number, the player whose hand is on top at that moment has to drink.
#  5. The game continues with the previous round's loser as the new leader.

# step 5: Ask the leader to enter a random number (int, whole number)
# step 6: Count up to the entered number by the Leader and select users randomly and assign the number
# step 7: The user who was selected randomly at the number entered by the leader has to drink.
# step 8: Pring "Drink!!! player number"
